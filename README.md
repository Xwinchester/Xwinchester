Hi, I'm Xwinchester! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about learning and exploring various coding languages and technologies, with a particular focus on manufacturing-related projects. I believe in harnessing the power of code to optimize and automate manufacturing processes.

- Python 🐍

- Java ☕

- AHK (AutoHotkey) 🎮

- VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) 📊

- G code (CNC language) and Macro B 🛠️

I enjoy diving into new coding projects and continuously expanding my knowledge. If you're interested in any of these languages or have any exciting projects, feel free to reach out!
