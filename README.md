# Hi, I'm Drew! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about coding and its applications in the world of CNC machining and manufacturing. I believe in harnessing the power of code to optimize and automate manufacturing processes, making them more efficient and precise.

## My Coding Toolkit 🛠️

Here are some of the languages and technologies I work with:

- Python 🐍: For scripting, data analysis, and CAM-Assistant.

-  C# for Report Creation 📊: Crafting automated reporting solutions for CNC processes.
  
- Java ☕: Minimal experience in small projects

- VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) 📊: Enhancing productivity in CNC report generation.

- G code (CNC language) and Macro B 🛠️: Crafting precise CNC instructions.

I'm always eager to dive into new coding projects and explore innovative ways to improve CNC machining processes. If you share my passion for coding in the world of CNC machining or have exciting projects in this field, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's collaborate and push the boundaries of manufacturing technology together!
