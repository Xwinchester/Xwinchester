# Hi, I'm Drew! 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m passionate about coding and its applications in CNC machining. My philosophy is to work smarter, not harder, by automating processes whenever possible to improve efficiency and repetitive tasks.

## My Coding Toolkit ðŸ› 

Here are some of the languages and technologies I work with:

- **Python** : For all things currently, Most enjoyable language I am currently working with

- **C#** : Automating parts of the setup sheet process for CNC programs using of Active Reports.
  
- **Java** : Minimal experience in small projects

- **VBA**: Creating an error-proof setup in Word, automating scheduling, filling out documents automatically based on specific part data, and a dashboard to manage the machinists' daily tasks.

- **Macro B** : CNC Machinist and Programmer.

I'm always eager to dive into new coding projects and explore innovative ways to improve CNC machining processes (or any process really). If you share my passion for coding in the world of CNC machining or have exciting projects in this field, please don't hesitate to reach out.
