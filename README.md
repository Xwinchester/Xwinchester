# Hi, I'm Drew! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about coding and its applications in the world of CNC machining and manufacturing. I believe in harnessing the power of code to optimize and automate manufacturing processes, making them more efficient and standardized.

## My Coding Toolkit 🛠️

Here are some of the languages and technologies I work with:

- Python 🐍: For all things currently, Most enjoyable language I am currently working with.

-  C# for Report Creation 📊: Creating setup sheets for CNC programs inside of Active Reports and Mastercam.
  
- Java ☕: Minimal experience in small projects

- VBA 📊: Enhancing the setup sheets from Mastercam inside of Word.

- G code and Macro B 🛠️: CNC Machinist and Mastercam Programmer.

I'm always eager to dive into new coding projects and explore innovative ways to improve CNC machining processes (or any process really). If you share my passion for coding in the world of CNC machining or have exciting projects in this field, please don't hesitate to reach out.
